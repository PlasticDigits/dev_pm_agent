# Post-Change Verification

After making code changes to this project, always run these commands before considering the work complete:

1. **Format**: `cargo fmt`
2. **Build (warnings as errors)**: `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo build`
3. **Tests**: `cargo test`

Run them in that order. Fix any failures or warnings before finishing. The `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` makes the build fail on any warning, so you must fix all warnings as part of each change. For Rust changes, this is the minimum verification step.
